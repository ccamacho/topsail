    The PSAP Operators Toolbox

    The toolbox is a set of tools, originally written for
    CI automation, but that appeared to be useful for a broader scope. It
    automates different operations on OpenShift clusters and operators
    revolving around PSAP activities: entitlement, scale-up of GPU nodes,
    deployment of the NFD, SRO and NVIDIA GPU Operators, but also their
    configuration and troubleshooting.
